# crypto-market-behavior-analysis
Exploratory data analysis of top cryptocurrencies focusing on price behavior, volatility, market sentiment, and drawdown patterns using historical OHLCV data.
Project Overview

This project analyzes historical price data of the top 50 cryptocurrencies to understand:

* Market behavior (bull vs bear days)

* Price volatility and drawdowns

* Long-term coverage and activity duration

* Risk characteristics across different assets

The goal is to extract actionable insights from raw market data using Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA).

# 📊 Dataset

* Individual CSV files for each cryptocurrency

* OHLCV format (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)

* Data coverage varies across assets

# 🔍 Analysis Steps

* Data loading and consolidation

* Coverage analysis (active days per crypto)

* Price behavior & daily returns

* Bull vs Bear market classification

* Volatility (daily & annualized)

* Drawdown analysis

* Comparative visualizations

# 📈 Key Insights

* Cryptocurrencies with longer market presence show more stable volatility

* High returns often come with deep drawdowns

* Bull/Bear ratios differ significantly across assets

* Volatility is a critical risk indicator beyond price movement

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* Python

* Pandas, NumPy

* Matplotlib, Seaborn

# 📌 Future Improvements

* Add correlation analysis

* Risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, Sortino)

* Time-series modeling
